## Notes

This is a react based website. It adapts to various screen sizes and 
uses firebase storage to store the images. 

The website has two routes 'Our Work' and 'Contact us'. The contact pages
has a form that is connected to Netlify Forms and the work page uses firebase storage. 
A small pagination feature has also been implemented. 

An `.env` file will need to be created to store firebase config variables. 


### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
